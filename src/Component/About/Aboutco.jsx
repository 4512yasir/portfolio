      <h1>who am I?</h1>
       <p>I am a web developer based in the  East of Nairobi Kenya.

I really enjoy solving problems as well as making things  easy to use. I can't stop learning new things; the more, the better. </p>
    <p className='about'>             For the front-end I usually work with Javascript, either standalone or including
              popular frameworks like ReactJS . I also make the web pretty by using Sass,
              CSS and, whenever needed, any of their friends: Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.</p>
              <p>I also Write articles about programming languages</p>
